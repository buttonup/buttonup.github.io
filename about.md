This is an explicitly anarchist project. Or rather, the values we have that spawned this project are often said to be anarchist:

- **Mutual aid**, or, we like being in relationships where all involved benefit and aren't competing.
- **DIY**, or, we like having more control over the things around us and acknowledge that having a hand in the production of things can substantially change our relationship to those things.
- **Fuck capitalism**, or, we are bored and frustrated with the usual pattern of buying and selling, and pay walls in front of everything interesting. Instead, we prefer things like sharing and sledgehammers.


When we got a button machine to make our own designs, we realized that other people have dope ideas for buttons, but lack access to a button maker. Once we made all the buttons that we wanted to make, our button maker was relegated to the closet and languished in the dust. Instead of letting zim stay lonely, we applied the values above and created Button Up. Let our button maker come out of the closet! ðŸŒˆ


We want to share our button maker with you and, like a sledgehammer, break down the walls in between your button idea and its physical expression, and the one between you and us. [Here's how!](/how)
