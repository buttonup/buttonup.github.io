This pin is a pin of a cat.

It’s about body positivity.

My parents recently moved away from the bay area to South Carolina. I will let that fact stand on it’s own. I took brief responsibility for Daisy. She stayed with me and my housemates for about five months. She really liked waking me up by hitting my face. She really liked laying in the sun. She really liked laying on her back, with her paws up in the air, laying in the sun. Now, she likes doing these things in South Carolina.

ACAB --- ALL CATS ARE BEAUTIFUL
