A man with a scruffy beard slams the door open and walks with a damn purpose
across the main room. This was where the firefighters' horse drawn carts used to be
parked. Past the wood burning furnace, he jumps up the metal spiral staircase two
steps at a time, cursing loudly, frightening Suede the black cat into the
closet upstairs. Suede peers out around the corner of the closet, curious but cautious. The
tenants peer out around the corner of their doorframes, curious but cautious.
Confused at what their landlord is huffing and puffing about, they follow him
into the master bedroom, curious but cautious. Suede stays.

The ex-cop takes a framed and signed poster of Van Halen off the wall, squeezes
his hands slowly into a fist, gives off a low battle moan and punches straight
into the wall.

Tenants are confused, concerned, curious but cautious. They just watch.

He rips dry wall out until he can fit his whole arm down to the base of the
inside of the wall. Out he pulls 2 bands of $100s, a pump action shotgun, and
a Colt M1911 pistol. He walks with a damn purpose out of the room, down the
spiral staircase, past the furnace, across the main room, and slams the door
behind him. No one sees him again.

This was the moment the firehouse became a squat, and that was one of many origin
stories of the firehouse. Since then it's become a punk house housing DIY
fiends, noise musicians, dozens of guitars, some anarchists, good vibes, and
a real-feeling community. Living there was and is dope.
