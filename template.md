The button maker that we have is the 1.5" round button machine from Tecre, so these template files are specific to that machine and the pinback button parts that it takes.

There are three concentric circles for each button in the template. The outer circle marks where the button should be cut. The inner circle marks the recommended maximum picture size; if your design exceeds this boundary, it will wrap over the side of the button. The middle circle denotes where a tagline, if you have one, should be placed. The tagline is a cool way to supplement your design with a hidden message, website link, or anything else you can think of!
