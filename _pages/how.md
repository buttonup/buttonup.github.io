How do you get your own button designs in your hands?

We want three things from you in exchange for buttons:

1. Partial designs
1. A story
1. A picture

### Partial designs
Buttons are made in three steps: by printing or drawing in a circle on paper, cutting or punching out the design, and then using a button making machine to press a plastic cover over the paper design onto a metal back with a pin.

We have the machine, you have the design!

If you make the design yourself, email it to us at [buttonup@riseup.net](mailto:buttonup@riseup.net). Please use our [default template!](/template)

If you don't feel like your design chops are up to the task, email us the idea you have with as much visual and emotional information as you can, and we'll make the design for you.

### A story
We ain‚Äôt giving you the buttons for nothing. We want a story! Something related to the button design. Maybe why you want the button, what it means to you, where the thoughts around it came from, a fictional or non-fictional or fantastical account of a day in the life of the button or the subject of the button, or a really just any bunch of text that relates to the button in some way. Be creative!

### A picture
Alongside the story, we want a picture. This picture comes after we send you the buttons. We want to see the button in the wild. Perhaps where it will be living, or in the context of its conception, or just somewhere pretty. Be creative!


Primarily, we want the story and picture for our entertainment. Secondarily, we want to produce an artifact on this site for others to enjoy. That's the deal :)

### Fuck the deal

If you don't want to follow the rules we just laid out here and have a better idea of how to interact with us and our button maker, send us an email. We're open to doing things differently for special snowflakes like you ‚ùÑÔ∏èüíñ
